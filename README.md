# Lunchbox.io
A php webapp that has a  similar structure as the medium website. Well sort of.

The paid account is either 5$ of 10$.

### Side note

The ui isn't looking that great. 

That is upto whoever adopts the project.

Though I'll be updating the ui soon.

The backend and the front end work fine.
